## Authors

this module is a rewrite of the initial module made by Håkon Nessjøen [haakon@bitfocus.io]() and its the contributor ndreas H. Thomsen [mc-hauge@hotmail.com]()

As the module doesn't work in the latest versions of [Companion](https://bitfocus.io), I have decided to port it for [Companion](https://bitfocus.io) vesrion 3 and higher.

## Warnings

This module has been tested only on an AV-HS410 with AUX_IP plugin v 2.02,  and HS410_IF v2.02 enabled.
